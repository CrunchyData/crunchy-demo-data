This is all public domain data to be used with Crunchy Data demos and tutorials

The python scripts will generate data that works with the DDL in the output directory and the PostgreSQL COPY command
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-copy.html

## Possible other data to grab
- U.S. dept of Labor enforcement
https://enforcedata.dol.gov/views/data_catalogs.php

Would be good to show off geocoding with OSM or Tiger data and PostGIS
