There are 3 files only 1 of which contains location data. They are just for the calendar year 2018

There are many more years if doing temporal work is desired.

According to the NOAA site (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/):

_The Storm Events Database contains the records used to create the official NOAA Storm Data publication, documenting:

    1. The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause 2. loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce;
    2. Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area; and
    3. Other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with another event.
