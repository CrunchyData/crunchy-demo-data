# Wikipedia Data on U.S. Counties

This script goes through and first pulls all the counties off this page:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_and_county_equivalents

and then calls the Wikimedia JSON API to pull down the content of each linked county.

The current output data was crawled on April 8th, 2019.
