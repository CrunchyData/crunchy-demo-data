According to the NASA  site (https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/):

    EONET is a repository of metadata about natural events. EONET is accessible via web services. EONET will drive your natural event application
    ...
    Curation of events in EONET plays a big role in the system and while we are still working to determine what exactly constitutes an event in both temporal and spatial extents, we are also very interested in hearing your opinions on sources, types, and any feedback that you might have.   
    ...
    EONET metadata is for visualization and general information purposes only and should not be construed as "official" with regards to spatial or temporal extent. 

The data is international but not exhaustive. It contains JSON records with descriptions and embbeded GeoJSON
